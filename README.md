What I Learned
This project helped me understand modern Android development patterns, especially working with Compose for UI, handling API responses with proper error states, and structuring code with MVVM architecture.

The pagination implementation was particularly interesting - detecting when users scroll near the end and automatically loading more content while showing appropriate loading indicators.
